# **Fake News Prediction Model using Logistic Regression**

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting fake news, developed in a Jupyter notebook using Google Colab. The model uses **Logistic Regression** to classify news articles as real or fake based on various textual features.

## **Key Features**

- **Binary Classification**: Classifies news articles as either fake or real.
- **Logistic Regression**: Utilizes Logistic Regression, a commonly used linear model, for binary classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves a competitive accuracy in detecting fake news.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare the text data for modeling.
- **Dataset**: Trained and validated on a labeled dataset of fake and real news articles.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Implements various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, to evaluate the model.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of model performance through graphs and charts, aiding in the understanding of its efficacy.
